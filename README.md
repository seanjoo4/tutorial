## How to Access Your Website without IntelliJ
Remember, when accessing your website on IntelliJ, it's only for you (aka, local) and no one else can see it. <br>
By creating a link on GitHub, we can have a link where you can share to anyone else. 
### Steps
1. On your portfolio repository, there should be a Settings tab (next to the Insights tab) click that <br>
2. Next, the first thing under Settings should be repository. Change that to: USERNAME.github.io (USERNAME should be replaced with your GitHub username. So, for me it's seanjoo4.github.io) and then save. <br>
3. Now, scroll down and there should be a GitHub Pages column and press the hyperlink: Check it out here! <br>
4. Most likely, there will be a blue box saying: "Your site is ready to be published at YOUR URL LINK" <br>
5. If this is the case, wait a few minutes (maximum 5 minutes). If it's still not changing to a green box saying: "Your site is published at YOUR URL LINK", click the Change theme button under Theme Chooser and press the green Select Theme button. <br>
6. Make sure that under Source, it should say Branch: main and /root next. If not, change it and save. <br>
7. Finally, wait again for a few more minutes, and it should turn green with your current website! <br>

If you have any questions, let me know.
